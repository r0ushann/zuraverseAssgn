Please go to `contracts/SeedToken.sol` for the logic and checks for the token smart contract with all the required logic and checks.

## The code works well as per Remix EVM deployment and all the functions are tested there only.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
